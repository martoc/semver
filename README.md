# semver

When SemVer and Conventional Commits are used together, they create a powerful system for version control and release management. 
Developers follow the Conventional Commits format when making changes, and the commit messages provide valuable information about 
the nature of the changes.

A tool that integrates both SemVer and Conventional Commits can automate the process of determining the appropriate version number 
based on the commit history. It can analyze the types of commits (features, fixes, etc.) and determine the appropriate version bump 
(MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH) based on the nature of the changes. The tool can also consider breaking changes and pre-release information.
